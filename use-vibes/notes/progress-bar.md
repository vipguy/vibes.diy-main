# Progress Bar Implementation

## Current Task

Restore the progress bar functionality during image generation to match previous behavior.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Progress Bar Display**

   - Progress bar needs to be visible during both initial image generation and regeneration
   - CSS class naming consistency between components (`imggen-progress` vs `imggen-progress-bar`)
   - Structure and styling of progress indicators

2. **Implementation Locations**

   - `ImgGen.tsx`: Main component with progress display during both generating and regenerating states
   - `ImgGenDisplayPlaceholder.tsx`: Handles progress display during initial generation
   - `ImgGenDisplay.tsx`: Handles progress display during regeneration

3. **Testing**
   - Tests in `ImgGenPlaceholder.test.tsx` verify correct progress bar implementation and positioning
   - Progress animation timing adjusted to ensure smooth transitions

## Current Status

- Progress bar appears during regeneration (when an image is shown) but is not visible during initial image generation
- It should switch to the generating view with current prompt during initial image generation
- Need to ensure the progress functionality works consistently across all states
- Important to maintain the original implementation structure from previous commits
- All tests passing with the current implementation

## Next Steps

- Ensure progress bar is visible in the Simple Image Generator demo during first-time generation
- Maintain consistency with the rest of the component design
- Avoid introducing breaking changes to the API or test suite
