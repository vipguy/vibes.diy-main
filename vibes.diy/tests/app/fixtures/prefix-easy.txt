I'll create an "Exoplanet Tracker" app that lets users log and track potential exoplanets they've discovered or are interested in. This combines astronomy with note-taking in an orange synthwave aesthetic.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useFireproof } from "use-fireproof";

export default function ExoplanetTracker() {
  const { useDocument, useLiveQuery, database } = useFireproof("exoplanet-tracker");
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("list"); // UI state only
