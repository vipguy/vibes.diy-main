# Data Tab Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks progress on implementing the data tab feature as outlined in [data-tab.md](./data-tab.md).

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Add Data Tab UI (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Updated type definitions to include 'data' alongside 'code' and 'preview'
  - Modified ResultPreviewTypes.ts with updated type definitions
  - Updated typing in IframeContent.tsx, ResultPreview.tsx
  - Updated home.tsx to handle the new 'data' view type

- ✅ Added Data tab button in the tab switcher
  - Modified ResultPreviewHeaderContent.tsx to add a Data tab with appropriate icon
  - Applied consistent styling to match existing tabs
- ✅ Added data content container in IframeContent
  - Created a separate `<div>` for data content with visibility controls
  - Used same visibility pattern as code and preview tabs
  - Applied consistent styling with dark/light mode support

### Phase 2: Database Access Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

- ✅ Created database discovery mechanism
  - Implemented functionality to scan code for useFireproof() calls
  - Added support for detecting template-based database names (with sessionId variables)
  - Included fallback to common database names

- ✅ Added initial database display components
  - Created DatabaseListView component to display discovered databases
  - Created DatabaseData component to fetch and display database contents
  - Added IndexedDB direct access to query database contents

- ✅ Implemented data visualization components
  - Added DynamicTable component for displaying database records
  - Created dynamicTableHelpers.ts with utilities for processing document data
  - Implemented smart header detection based on document fields

## Pending Work

- Complete the real-time sync between data tab and preview
- Enhance CRUD operations functionality
- Consider standardizing database naming (Phase 3)

## Technical Implementation Details

- The database discovery works by parsing the application code using regex to find useFireproof() calls
- Data is fetched directly from IndexedDB storage
- The UI dynamically adapts to show relevant document fields based on available data
- The implementation respects dark/light mode settings from the parent application

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 2 items
2. Test the data tab with various application templates
3. Consider user experience improvements based on testing
4. Evaluate if Phase 3 (standardize database naming) is necessary
