- **Message**: First rough pass for esm.sh based app generation

## Overview

This commit represents the first implementation of esm.sh-based application generation in the AI App Builder. The changes focus on improving the preview infrastructure to better support ESM modules loaded from esm.sh.

## Key Changes

### 1. UI and Layout Improvements

- Modified CSS classes in `AppLayout.tsx` to fix mobile preview visibility issues
- Changed from conditional hiding to always visible with adjusted height/opacity

### 2. ResultPreview Component Refactoring

- Reorganized imports for better code organization
- Added support for child components to enable header content integration
- Implemented state propagation for preview ready and bundling status
- Modified iframe message handling for better ESM compatibility
- Added event listener for 'preview-ready' in addition to 'preview-loaded'
- Updated iframe selector from '.sp-preview-iframe' to generic 'iframe'

### 3. Preview Behavior Logic

- Added automatic view switching when code is ready and streaming ends
- Improved iframe communication for API key transmission
- Enhanced mobile preview handling

### 4. Configuration Changes

- Updated vite.config.ts to use wildcard ngrok hostnames (.ngrok-free.app)
- Reordered imports for better readability

### 5. Dependencies

- Extensive formatting changes to package lock files
- Added or updated resolution fields for various dependencies

## ESM.sh Integration Context

This commit establishes the foundation for using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) as a CDN for ESM modules. ESM.sh is a service that provides ESM versions of npm packages, allowing them to be directly imported in the browser without bundling.

The changes focus on:

1. Preparing the UI/preview infrastructure to handle ESM modules
2. Modifying iframe communication to work with ESM-loaded applications
3. Adjusting event handling for the different loading behavior of ESM modules

## Risks and Considerations

- The commit message describes this as a "first rough pass," indicating that this is an initial implementation
- The API key handling mechanism is being modified without clear security boundaries
- The event handling changes may affect compatibility with non-ESM applications
- The wildcard ngrok hostname configuration could have security implications

## Next Steps

- Improve error handling for ESM module loading failures
- Enhance security around API key transmission to iframes
- Add comprehensive testing for ESM-based applications
- Consider performance optimizations for loading modules from external CDNs

This commit represents a significant architectural shift toward using ESM modules loaded directly from CDN rather than bundled applications. This approach offers advantages in development speed and simplicity but requires careful security and performance considerations.
