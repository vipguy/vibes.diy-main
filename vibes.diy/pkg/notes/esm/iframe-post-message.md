# Rapid App.jsx Switcher with ESM

## For a Rapid App.jsx Switcher Implementation

The current approach with ESM.sh in the import map provides an elegant solution for dynamic imports. Here's how it would work in a rapid App.jsx switcher:

1. **Initial Setup**: Create the iframe once with all static content, including:
   - Import map (React, ReactDOM, use-fireproof, call-ai)
   - html2canvas and other utilities
   - Event listeners for postMessage

2. **Dynamic App.jsx Updates**: When new App.jsx content arrives:
   - Send just the component code via postMessage
   - Use `eval()` or a more controlled approach to update the React component
   - Re-render without reloading the entire iframe

3. **New Module Imports**: This is where ESM.sh shines:
   - If App.jsx contains imports for new modules, they can be dynamically added to the import map
   - The import map can be updated in real-time without reloading the entire page
   - ESM.sh handles versioning and dependency resolution

The beauty of ESM is that new modules can be imported on demand. You can either:

1. **Predefined Import Map**: Include common modules in the initial import map
2. **Dynamic Import Map Updates**: When new modules are detected in App.jsx, send the updated import map via postMessage and apply it

## Addressing the Top 5 Technical Debt Items

1. **Inefficient Iframe Reloading**:
   - Keep a single iframe instance alive throughout the session
   - Use a module evaluation approach rather than rebuilding the entire iframe
   - Implement content-only updates via postMessage

2. **Inconsistent API Key Handling**:
   - Standardize on the direct embedding approach if security isn't a concern
   - Remove legacy postMessage code for API keys

3. **Broken Screenshot Functionality**:
   - Include html2canvas in the initial iframe setup
   - Ensure screenshot capture functions are present in the template
   - Properly wire up event listeners in both parent and iframe

4. **Dual Code Paths and Dead Code**:
   - Clean up commented-out code
   - Standardize on one selector approach (either generic iframe or specific class)
   - Remove the unused timeout mechanism

5. **Incomplete Migration to ESM**:
   - Complete the ESM implementation across all files
   - Update all dependent components to work with the ESM approach
   - Remove any bundle-specific code that's no longer needed

The ESM.sh approach makes new module imports easy because:

1. It handles dependency resolution automatically
2. It serves browser-compatible ESM versions of npm packages
3. It works well with dynamic import maps, allowing for runtime module additions
