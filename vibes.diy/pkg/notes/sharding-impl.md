# Database Sharding Implementation Review

The database sharding implementation successfully splits data between a main session metadata database and individual session-specific databases, following the design specified in `sharding.md`.

## Core Changes

1. **Database Management Layer**
   - Created `databaseManager.ts` with clear separation of concerns
   - Implements consistent naming convention with `vibe-${sessionId}` for session databases

2. **Hook Modifications**
   - `useSession`: Updated to maintain session metadata in main DB while storing messages in session-specific DB
   - `useSessionList`: Converted from single-database query to async loading pattern for session screenshots
   - `useSimpleChat`: Updated references to use session-specific database

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added database selection UI in `DatabaseListView.tsx` to allow browsing different databases
   - Shows both main database and session-specific database

## Key Implementation Details

- Maintained backward compatibility with existing references
- Added proper error handling for database access
- Implemented async data loading with states for better UX
- Created comprehensive test mocks to support the new database structure

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **Unnecessary Code**:
   - Some test changes included unrelated formatting changes
   - `notes/evolve.js` appears unrelated to the sharding implementation

2. **Potential Optimizations**:
   - Consider pagination for session list when there are many sessions
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed screenshots in session list

3. **Missing Elements**:
   - No explicit migration utility for existing data
   - No version detection to handle pre-sharding data

## Overall Assessment

The implementation successfully achieves the goal of separating session data into individual databases, which should improve performance and scalability. The core architecture changes match the design in the sharding plan, with appropriate modifications to maintain the application's functionality.

The naming scheme using `vibe-${sessionId}` is consistently applied throughout the codebase.
